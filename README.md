# Lights-Camera-SQL-Unraveling-Movie-Insights

Hello fellow cinephiles!
Welcome to my movie dataset project—a thrilling journey through film data using SQL queries. Whether you’re a director, a critic, or just someone who loves the magic of the silver screen, this repository has something for you.

Project Highlights:
Dataset: The Movie Dataset contains information about films, genres, ratings, cast, cast, director and reviewer.

Objective: My mission? To extract hidden gems, blockbuster trends, and cinematic curiosities from this treasure trove of data.

Approach:
I answered questions such as:
“Which genre dominates the box office?”
“Who are the most prolific actors?”
“What’s the correlation between ratings and revenue?”
“When the movie 'American Beauty' released. Return movie release year?”
“Find name of all the reviewers who rated the movie 'Slumdog Millionaire?”
“Write a query to determine the Top 7 movies which were released in United Kingdom. Sort the data in ascending order of the movie year?”
etc.

Repository Contents:
SQL Scripts: Dive into my queries—they’re the screenplay of this data-driven drama.
Results: Peek behind the curtain at raw query outputs and eye-catching question and answer script.
README: Your backstage pass—installation instructions, usage tips, and a sneak peek at the sequel (future enhancements).
So grab your virtual ticket, find your seat, and let’s roll the data! 🌟🎞️
